## Data
The Self-Sufficiency Standard data includes 147 files in Excel file format (xlsx, xlsb) by state and year. Each file lists counties with family types and related costs, such as housing, child care, and food costs. Most columns are consistent across files, but a few columns that contain extra information are present in specific files. For example, broadband and cell phone costs are only included in 6 files.
